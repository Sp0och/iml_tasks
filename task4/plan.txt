Given:
-Pretrain Dataset with 50'000 entries (of size 1000) and respective Labels being Humo-Energy
-Small Train Dataset with 100 entries (of size 1000) and respective labels being Humo-Lumo Gap
-Test Feature Dataset with 10000 entries (of size 1000) without labels
-We know that Humo-Energy and Humo-Lumo gap are relatively closely connected

We want to:
-Predict Humo_Lumo_Gap from the test feature dataset

Battleplan:
- Perform dimensionality reduction to reduce feature size
- Build and train a neural network on the dim reduced pretrain dataset
- Apply transfer learning to adapt pretrain NN to current task
- Fit transferred NN with Train Dataset 
- Predict Humo-Lumo-Gap from the Test Dataset
